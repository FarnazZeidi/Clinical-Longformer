We used OpenI as an example to illustrate how Clinical-Longformer can be applied to document classification tasks. 

OpenI is a publicly available chest x-ray (CXR) dataset collected by Indiana University. The dataset provides around 4,000 radiology reports and their associated human annotated Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Given the small sample size, we will only use OpenI as the testing set. The pre-trained language models are trained using MIMIC-CXR, another publicly available chest x-ray dataset. The annotated findings overlap between the two CXR data sources are the diagnosis of: *Cardiomegaly, Edema, Consolidation, Pneumonia, Atelectasis, Pneumothorax and Pleural Effusion*.
